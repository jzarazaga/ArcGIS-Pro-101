Jessie Marshall Zarazaga - GIS@SMU - jzarazaga@smu.edu

*based on workshop by Stacey Maples, Geospatial Manager, stacemaples@stanford.edu Stanford Geospatial Center*

## Overview

Introduce basic vocabulary, concepts and techniques for working with spatial data in research. Introduce the interface / tools of ESRI ArcGIS Pro, desktop GIS software.  

## Setup

**Software** - 
Install the ArcGIS Pro software.

**Data**

Download the zip folder:  https://smu.box.com/v/IntroGISPro

Right-click on the *.zip and select Extract All.  Save on your DESKTOP.

Open the folder and look at the data: 
* **snow_map.png** - this is a non-georeferenced image of the map from John Snow’s original report on the cholera outbreak of 1854.

* **deathAddresses.csv**  - this is a table of latitude and longitude coordinates for addresses affected by the cholera outbreak. This table also contains the number of deaths at each address.  

* **London.shp** - a shapefile showing all the boroughs of the modern city of London.

* **Study_Area.shp** - A rectangular feature that describes our area of interest.  

#### Additional Files
an extra backup data folder that contains versions of files that we will create during the workshop.  


## Open the ‘Snow_map’ Image  
![./media/SnowMap.png](./media/SnowMap.png)

This is the famous map drawn by Dr John Snow, the founding father of modern epidemiology.  London suffered a series of cholera outbreaks during the mid-19th century, and Snow theorized that cholera was spread through contaminated water, rather than the prevailing theory of spread through "miasma" in the air.

London's water supply system consisted of shallow public wells where people could pump water to carry home; the sewage system of privies emptied into cesspools or cellars. The pervasive stench made the miasma theory very plausible. 

During the 1854 cholera outbreak Snow mapped the 13 public wells and all the known cholera deaths in the Soho district, near his home, and noted the spatial clustering of cases around the Broad Street water pump.  He had the pump handle removed from the Broad Street pump and the outbreak quickly subsided. Snow subsequently published a map of the epidemic to support his theory, showing the locations of the 13 wells and the addresses of the 578 cholera deaths, marked as stacked black bars.  
Our goal in this workshop is to explore the cholera outbreak of 1854 and determine whether there is evidence that the Broad Street pump is the source of the outbreak. We will map the locations and numbers of the cholera deaths, and compare them to the nearest water pumps.


### Create a Map Document

1. Create a new map document. Open ArcGIS Pro. Login with ArcGIS login.
2. Select “Start without a template.” A blank ArcGIS Pro interface opens.. 
3. Switch to the **Insert** Tab at the top of ArcGIS Pro. Click on the **New Map** button to add a basemap and create a view similar to that, below:

![arcgispro_newmap.png](./media/arcgispro_newmap.png)

#### The Basic Components of the ArcGIS Pro Interface

The ArcGIS Pro interface is made up of three basic components:

**Ribbon** - Ribbon toolbar at the top which organizes tools into themes, such as Map and Analysis. **Get used to starting with the Ribbon.**

**The Data/Map Frame** – Map canvas where data visualizations appear.   

**The Table of Contents** - Where the “Layers” and datasets appear, as they are added to the map.   
 (Others tools appear on the Ribbon when their context is enabled.   eg. Click on a basemap layers to enable the ***Vector Tile Layer*** **Appearance** tab which allows you to set scale-dependent rendering and transparency.)

**Ribbon** - ArcGIS Pro uses a ribbon toolbar at the top of the interface which organizes tools into related themes, such as Map and Analysis. Other themes will appear when their context is enabled. For instance, clicking on one of the basemap layers enables the **Vector Tile Layer Appearance** tab, which provides for setting scale-dependent rendering and transparency.

![./media/map_ribbon.png](./media/map_ribbon.png)  

### Add a GIS shapefile data layer

1.	Go back again to the **Insert** Tab at the top of ArcGIS Pro. Click on the **Add Folder** button, browse to the workshop folder **‘ArcGIS Pro JohnSnow’** but don’t open it. Press **OK.**
2.	In the Catalogue pane, click on the down arrow for **Folders > ArcGIS-Pro-JohnSnow > data > London_Borough.shp**, and drag that shapefile onto the map.

![./media/london.png](./media/london.png)  

### Explore Navigation Tools and Visibility 
Most GIS navigation is quite familiar- using the mouse and mouse wheel.  Press to Pan, role to zoom. 
Look on the MAP tab, in the ‘Navigate’ set of tools, for the various ‘zoom options.  If you glide over each tool it will describe it.  They’re quite self-explanatory. Try them!

![./media/explore.png](./media/explore.png) 

### Working with Layers 
#### Display Order  
The Layer Order in the **Contents** determines the order of display in your Map, when it is listed by 'Drawing Order Mode'.  (you can also display your Contents as 'List by Source')
Click and Drag the **London** layer to the bottom of **Contents**.  It has gone behind the basemap.  Drag it back!
#### ESRI 'Cloud' Basemap Data
As default with a new Map, ArcGIS Pro provides a pre-designed cartographic basemap to give your data geographic context.  You can turn this layer on or off, or change it.  
On the **Map** Tab, go to **Basemap**, and select **‘Light Grey Canvas’** or any alternative basemap.

![./media/basemap.png](./media/basemap.png) 

### Feature Layer Tab
Most layer manipulation can be done under the **Feature Layer** tabs.  There are also short-cuts to do these tasks but the **Feature Layer** tab offers primary paths to work with layers.  
*(Note: almost every sub-command in Arc can be found 2 ways; as an icon on the feature tab, or by right-click and ‘properties’ in the contents for those familiar with ArcMap)*

Click onto the **London** layer.                   
The **Feature Layer** (orange) set of tabs appears at the top of the screen.  

There are 3 tabs:     ***Appearance, Labeling*** and ***Data***. 

***Appearace***: If you press **Symbology**, you can change all aspects of the appearance of your data. Change the color by pressing on the Symbol square in the right window. *(Or right click on the layer)*

***Labeling***: Press the option **‘Label’** The default Field shown will be Name, and all the Borough names will show on your map.

***Data*** tab; The second block has a button for the **‘attribute table’**.  Press it.  This is the data table from which this set of polygon shapes has been drawn. *(Or right-click on the layer in the contents window.)*

![./media/attribute.png](./media/attribute.png) 

1.	Open the Attribute table:  **Feature Layer > Data > Attribute Table**  *(Shortcut: right-click on the  layer and slide down to Attribute Table)*

![./media/attribute_table.png](./media/attribute_table.png) 

2.	You can sort fields by Ascending, scroll through the data, add additional fields to the table etc.

#### The Selection Tools
The Selection tools Provide ways to select features within a layer as well as by Attributes.  Test, then Clear selection.

![./media/selectiontoolbar.png](./media/selectiontoolbar.png) 

#### Layer Visibility
The Table of Contents controls Layer Visibility using the checkbox next to each Layer.
 Use the Visibility Checkbox next to the London Layer to turn off the layer. 





Now we're going to add an existing data layer. The data layer that we will add describes our **Area Of Interest** in this study. This layer will provide us with a convenient way to orient our data frame to the area that we are interested in, as well as providing a way to limit the processing extent of certain geo-processing tools.

1. In the **Catalog panel**, right-click on the **Folders** item and click on "Add folder connection."  Browse to the data folder for this workshop, select and clikc **Add**
2. Expand the newly added data folder, and drag-and-drop the Study_Area.shp file into your **Map** frame.
3. Right click on the **color patch** for the newly added layer, in the Table of Contents and select **No color**


![](./media/add_layer.png)

### Save the project


### Create a data layer from an XY table?

Often the data sets that you want to work with will not come as spatial data sets. In this step we will add a table of data that contains fields with the latitude and longitude coordinates of the deaths addresses we want to analyze.

1. Return to the Catalog Panel and, in the data folder, right-click on the deathAddresses.csv and select Export>Table to Point Feature Class. This will open the **XY Table to Point** Geoprocessing Tool as a tab on top of the Catalog Panel.
2. For **Output Feature Class**, check that the feature class will be exported to the default.gdb in your project folder and replace the default name with "**Deaths**"
3. The remaining settings should be as shown below:  
![](./media/XYtopoints.png)  
4. Click **Run** and wait for the points to be added to the Map panel.

![](./media/deathsadded.png)

### Layer symbology  
#### Proportional symbols on Deaths  

1. Right-click on the Deaths layer, in the Table of Contents, and select Symbology... to open the Symbology Panel tab on top of the Catalog and Geoprocessing Panels that are already opened.
2. Use the Drop-down to change the Primary Symbology to **Proportional Symbols** and set the Field=Num_Cases
3. Note in the **Histogram** and the bottom of the panel that the range of values for the Num_Cases is 1-8. Set the Minimum size = 1.00 and the Maximum size = 18, accordingly.
4. Click on the Template for the symbol and select Circle 3 (40%). Return to the Symbology panel by clicking on the back arrow at the top of the panel.  

![](./media/proportionalsymbols.png)

#### Bonus: Setting a Reference Scale

1. Now that you have created a symbology, zoom in and out of the daMap/Data Frame to see how the symbology interacts with the scale of the map. Note that the symbology remains the same size, regardless of the scale that you are viewing the map. 
2. Right-click on the **Map** item at the top of the **Table of Contents** and select **Properties**, to open the **Map Properties** dialog.
3. In the **General** table, change the **Reference scale** option to 1:5000. Click OK to apply the setting.
4. Zoom in and out of the Map to see that the symbols now change size with the scale of the map. 

![](./media/referencescale.png)

### Explore Map tools

Now we will explore the **Map tools** in ArcGIS Pro. 

The **Map/Navigate Toolbar** provides the bulk of the tools for navigation in
the **Map Frame**. Navigation in the ArcGIS Pro Map is accomplished using the mouse to click-&-drag, and the scrolling wheel to zoom in and out, similar to web "slippy" maps. 

![](./media/navigatetoolbar.png) 



* The **Zoom Tools** allow you to:  
![](./media/zoomtools.png) 
	* Zoom to Full Extent 
	* Zoom to Selection 
	* Fixed Zoom In & Out 
	* Next & Previous Extent



### Spatial Bookmarks

![](./media/bookmarks.png) 

Often, we want to be able to move around in our data frame examining different parts of the map zooming in and out, and then returning to our primary area of interest. This can be easily accommodated through the use of spatial bookmarks. Here you'll create a spatial bookmark which allows us to quickly return to the area that we are interested in.

1. Previously we used the main menu to enable a panel. This time, try right-clicking in any empty area of the toolbar then scroll down and select the **Spatial Bookmarks panel** from the menu that is presented.
2. Right-click on your study_area layer and select **Zoom to layer**.
3. Click on the **Add Bookmark** button and rename the resulting Spatial Bookmark: "**SOHO**"  
![](./media/spatialbookmark.png)
4. Click on the **Zoom Full** button to zoom to the world, then use the **Zoom to bookmark ** button to return to your Area of Interest.

### The Layers Tools

![](./media/layertoolbar.png)  

The **Layer tools** provide the ability to Add or change the basemap for the Map Frame, as well as adding existing data from a number of sources (File, Web Services, etc...). 
### The Selection Tools

![](./media/selectiontoolbar.png)  

The **Selection tools** Provide ways to select features within a layer interactively, by intersection with other layers, as well as by Attributes. 

## Working with spatial data
### Viewing the Attribute Table

Up to this point we've been mostly concerned with building a new map project. Now we'd like to take a peek at some of the data behind the Map Frame.

1. Right-click on the **Deaths** layer in the **Table of Contents** and select **Attribute Table**.
2. Note that you can sort fields, scroll, select by attributes, etc...

### Statistics on a field  

As mentioned, above, the **Num_Cases** field in the Deaths layer indicates the number of deaths at each address in the dataset. You can get a simple statistical snapshot of the variable from the Attribute Table.

1. Right-click on the header of the **Num_Cases** field and select **Statistics**
2. A histogram of the data distribution will appear over the top of the Attribute Table, and a "Distribution of Num_Cases" panel will appear in the tabbed panel area, on the right. 
3. On the window select **Death Addresses** as the Input Vector layer and **Num_Cases** as the Target field.
4. **Click Run** and **Close** 
5. Look for the **Results Viewer** panel which should have been activated, and click on the **Hyperlink** to open the summary in a web browser.

## Creating Spatial Data

### Georeference a map  

Our goal in this workshop is to explore the cholera outbreak of 1854 and determine whether there is evidence that the Broad Street pump is the source of the outbreak. To do this we want to spatially allocate all of the death addresses in our data set to the water pump that they are nearest. Often the data that we need for our analysis doesn't exist in the format that we need it in. In this section we will use John Snow's original map of the 1854 cholera outbreak as a source for the locations of the water pumps in our analysis. 

1. Browse to the data folder and drag-and-drop the **snow_map.png** image into the Map of your project. 
2. Click Yes when prompted to "Build pyramids..."
![](./media/pyramids.png)
3. Note that the layer is added to the Table of Contents, but doesn't' not yet appear in the Map Data Frame.
4. Click on the **snow_map.png** Layer to select it and then click on the Imagery tab to activate the Imagery tools. Click on the Georeference Tool to open the Georeferencing Tools and start georeferencing.  
![](./media/georeferencebutton.png)  
5. Right-click and "Zoom to..." the **snow_map.png**, then use the mouse scroll button to zoom to the upper left corner of the image, where the **Regent Circus** can be found.
6. Click on the **Add Control Points** tool and then place a Control Point Link at the center of Regent Circus.  
![](./media/firstgcplink.png)  
7. Right-click and "Zoom to..." the **Study_Area** layer. Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom into the same area of Regent Circus, and place the second GCP link at that location. Note that the map image will automatically "snap" these two GCP links together.  
![](./media/secondgcplink.png)  
8. Use the scroll wheel to zoom out and then into the bottom right corner of the **snow_map.png** layer to find the Intersection of **Oxendon Street & Coventry Street**. Add a Ground Control Point link to the Southeast corner of the intersection.
9. Toggle off the visibility of the **snow_map.png** and **right-click>Zoom to...** the **Study_Area** layer. 
10. Locate the corresponding intersection in the now visible basemap and place the second link of the Control Point. 
11. Toggle the visibility of the **snow_map.png** layer to see that it has "snapped" these two links together, as before. 
12. Locate and place 3 more **Ground Control Points** (1 in each remaining corner and one near the center).  
![](./media/allgcp.png)
13. Click on the **Export Control Points** button and save the control points you have created to your data folder as GCP.TXT.
14. Click on the **Save** button of the **Georeference** toolbar, then click on the **Close Georeference** button. 
15. Browse to the **data** folder using your Windows File Explorer and note that new files have been added to the folder. They include **snow_map.png.pgwx**, which is the "World File" for the image you just georeferenced. As long as this file sits next to the **snow_map.png** file, GIS applications, such as Google Earth Desktop, ArcGIS, QGIS, etc... should now be able to colocate this image with other datasets.  
![](./media/worldfile.png)
 
### Digitize features from a georeferenced map

If the last section didn't go well, add the ```John_Snow_Map.tif``` from the **/backup_data/**  

Now we would like to digitize the locations of the **Water Pumps** in the neighborhood, from the **john_snow.png**. To do this, we first need to create and  "empty" Feature Layer in our default.gdb for the project we are working on. 

1. Return to the Catalog panel and browse to **Databases**, right-click on the **Default.gdb** and go to **New>Feature Class** to begin the New Feature Class dialog.  
![](./media/newfeatureclass.png)  
2. In the resulting dialog, use these settings: **Name:** pumps; **Alias:** Water Pumps; **Feature Class Type:** Point. Click **Next**.  
![](./media/newfcstep1.png)  
3. Add a Field: **Field Name:** Label; **Data Type:** Text. Click **Next**.  
![](./media/newfcstep2.png)  
4. Set the **Spatial Reference** to **GCS WGS 1984**. Click **Finish**. 
![](./media/newfcstep3.png)   


### Add points to your Feature Class

1. Drag-and-Drop the new **pumps** Feature Class into your Map Frame. Note that the layer is added to the Table of Contents, using the alias: **Water Pumps**. 
2. With the **Water Pumps** layer selected in the Table of Contents, Click on the Edit Tab, at the top of ArcGIS Pro, to activate the Edit tools.   
![](./media/edittoolbar.png)  
3. Right-click on the **Water Pumps** layer and Open the **Attribute Table**. If it is not, already, drag the attribute table to dock it at the bottom of the Map Frame.
3. Click on the **Create** tool button, and note that a set of templates for each of your vector data layers will appear in as a panel on the right.  
![](./media/createbutton.png)  
4. Click on the **Water Pumps** template, in the **Create Features** panel on the right, to select the Water Pump point.  
5. Locate a Water Pump in the **snow_map.png** layer and click on it to place the point. 
6. In the Attribute Table, below, double-click on the new record, under the **Label** field and enter a value for the Label field (we will use the name of the nearest street), and hit **RETURN**.
7. Repeat for the remaining 12 water pumps in the Snow Map.  
![](./media/editpoint.png)  
8. Click the **Save** button and confirm to save your edits.
9. Close the **Create Features** Panel to close the edit session.
10. Close the Water Pumps Attribute Table.
11. Zoom to the Water Pumps.
12. Toggle off the visibility of the **snow_map.png** layer.  
![](./media/pumpswithlabels.png)  


### Bonus: Finding an already georeferenced map from DavidRumsey.com

There are many venues for searching for old maps as sources for spatial data and I've listed a few of our favorites, below. Of course, there are many considerations of scale, authority, projections, etc... when using a scanned map as a data source, it is possible to scan and georeference just about any map you can find reference data (another map to georeference to) for.

* [earthworks.stanford.edu](earthworks.stanford.edu)
* [DavidRumsey.com](DavidRumsey.com)
* [OldMapsOnline.com](OldMapsOnline.com)

We'll start by looking at this map [[Gegend von London 1853](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~298861~90066747:Gegend-von-London-1853?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&qvq=w4s:/where%2FLondon%2B%252528England%252529%2Fwhen%2F1854;q:london%201854;sort:Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&mi=1&trs=2)] of London on [https://davidrumsey.com](https://davidrumsey.com). It already has a "**Georeferenced** version, which can be viewed by clicking on the **Georeferencer** button at the top of the page.

![](./media/Gegend-drop-shadow.png)

David Rumsey makes Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant services available for  georeferenced maps on his site. This means that you can use the maps directly in most modern GIS applications, including ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, ArcGIS Online, etc...

### Adding a DavidRumsey.com WMTS map Service to ArcGIS Pro

Here is the **Web Map Tile Service WMTS URL** for the Gegend map:

## Basic spatial data analysis (Using Geoprocessing Tools in ArcGIS Pro)

### Voronoi (Thiessen) polygon (Spatial Allocation)

Thiessen polygons allocate space in an area of interest to a single feature per polygon. That is, within a Thiessen polygon, all other features are closer to the point that was used to generate that polygon than to any other point in the feature set. In this case, we will create a set of Thiessen polygons based upon the locations of the Water Pumps in our project. This will allow us to easily allocate all of the points in our death addresses dataset to the water pump that they are nearest using a simple spatial join.

1. At the top of **ArcGIS Pro**, click on the **Analysis tab**, then click on the **Tools button**, which will open the **Geoprocessing** panel at the right. 
2. Using the **Find Tools** box, Search for **Voronoi** and click on the **Create Thiessen Polygons** tool, in the results.
4. Set the options as: **Input Features:** Water Pumps; **Output Feature Class:** Voronoi: **Output Fields:** All fields.  
![](./media/voronoitool.png)  
5. Click on the **Environments** tab and set the **Extent:** **Same as:Study_Area**; and click **Run**.  
6. The result will be (as shown below) a layer of polygons that define the area closest to the water pumps that generated them.   
![](media/voronoi.png)  
7. Right-click on the new Voronoi layer and Open the Attribute table. Note that it contains the fields from the **Water Pumps**, including the **Label** field.  

### Spatial Join (Point Aggregation)

Now that you have created the Voronoi polygon layer, you will “allocate” each of the deaths to one of the Voronoi polygons. To do this, we will use a **Spatial Join**. Conceptually, what we will be doing is like passing our points through the polygons so that the polygon's attributes "stick" to the points.  

1. Right-click on the Deaths layer and go to **Joins and Relates>Spatial Join** to open the **Spatial Join** Geoprocessing tool.
2. Because the tool was opened from the **Deaths** layer, the **Target Features:** are correctly set. Use the drop-down to select **Voronoi** as the **Join Features** and change the **Output Feature Class** to **Deaths_Allocated**. The remaining default settings should appropriate.  
![](./media/spatialjoin.png)  
3. A new layer, called **Deaths_Allocated** will be added to the **Table of Contents**. Right-click on the new **Deaths_Allocated** layer and open the **Attribute Table** to confirm that each record now has the "**Label**" for the the nearest **Water Pump**.   
![](./media/labelfield.png)  

### Summary Statistics

Finally, we would like to summarize the deaths in the outbreak, grouping our summary by the name of the Water Pump that each Death Address is nearest. We will do this using the **Summary Statistics Tool** which allows us to do a statistical summary similar to the one we did earlier on the entire data set, but this time grouped by nearest water pump.

1. With the **Deaths_Allocated Attribute Table** still open, right-click on the header for the **Num_Cases** column and select **Summarize** to open the **Summary Statistics** Geoprocessing tool.
2. Use the drop-downs to set the Statistics Fields as shown, below:  
![](./media/summarystats.png)  
3. Set the **Case field** to the **Label** column, in order to group the summary by nearest **Water Pump**, and click **Run**.
4. Right-click the resulting **Deaths_Allocated_Statistics** table and Open it. Right-click on the **SUM_Num_Cases** field header and select **Sort Descending**  
![](./media/summarystatsresult.png)  

## Basic Measures of Spatial Central Tendency

### Spatial Mean (Mean Center)

The Mean Center is defined by the average x- and y-coordinate of all the features in the study area. It's useful for tracking changes in the distribution or for comparing the distributions of different types of features. Here, we will use the Mean Center to highlight the distribution of deaths around the Broad Street Pump.  

First, we will calculate a simple spatial mean. This is simply the mean center of the **distribution of locations** 

1. Click on the Analysis>Tools button to open the **Geoprocessing Panel**
2. In the *Find Tools* Search Box, search for "Mean Center"
3. The first result should be the **Mean Center** geoprocessing script. Click to **open** it's dialog.
4. Use **Deaths_Allocated** as the **Input Feature Class** and check that the **Output Feature Class** is going to your **Default.gdb** and has a meaningful name. Click **Run**.

A new Layer will be added to your Map with a single feature, representing the *Spatial Mean* of the distribution of *addresses* at which deaths took place. That is, we have determined the *Spatial Mean of the effected addresses*, but not the Spatial Mean of all of the deaths in the neighborhood. We can now use the Num_Cases field to calculate the *Spatial Mean* of all deaths in the outbreak, by calculating a **Weighted Spatial Mean**
![](media/spatialmean.png)

### Weighted Spatial Mean

1. **Run** the **Mean Center tool** again, this time assigning the **Num_Cases** field as the **Weight Field**. Rename the **Output Feature Class** by adding a "W" to the end of the filename of the previous run.
2. Right-click on the color patch for the resulting layer and select a color that contrasts with the color of the previous, unweighted, Spatial Mean. 

Note that, while the change is slight (this is a relatively small and uniform distribution of points), there is a noticeably movement of the **Weighted Spatial Mean**, towards the Broad Street Pump. 

![](media/weightedmean.png)

#### Bonus:  
Run the Weighted Spatial Mean again, this time setting the **Case Field** option to the "**Label**" field and observe the results. This has the effect of "casing" the spatial mean, based upon the spatial allocation that we did earlier. Do you notice anything about the general trend among all of the Spatial Means, cased by Water Pump?

![](media/casedmeans.png)

### Standard Distance

The Standard Distance is the spatial statistics equivalent of the standard deviation. It describes the radius around the spatial mean (or weighted spatial mean), which contains 68% of locations in your dataset. It can be very useful for working with GPS data.

1. Return to the Geoprocessing Tab, and click the **Back Arrow** to return to the **Search Results**. 
2. Search for "**Standard Distance**" and click on teh resulting **Standard Distance script tool**
3. Use your **Deaths_Allocated** layer as the **Input Feature Class**
4. Add a "**1**" to the end of the name of the **Output Standard Distance Feature Class** and confirm that the **Circle Size** is set to **1 standard deviation**
5. Use **Num_Cases** as the **Weight Field** and click **Run**.

![](media/oddsd.png)

The resulting Standard Distance circle, is not a circle. This is because we used unprojected data for the calculation, which geoprocessing tools that measure distance and area often have trouble with. If you look to the bottom of the Geoprocessing panel, you will notice that the **Standard Distance completed with warnings** and that hovering your mouse reveals more information about the error, including a clickable link.  

![](media/projectionwarning.png)

### Export your deaths data with a new projection

Here, we will export our **Deaths\_Allocated** dataset to a new version, while translating to a Projected Coordinate System that is appropriate for measuring distance at the scale of our project. 

1. Right-click on the **Deaths\_Allocated** layer, in the **Table of Contents** and go to **Data>Export Features**
2. Name the **Output Feature Class** **Deaths\_Allocated\_UTM** 
3. Click on the **Environments Tab**, at the top of the Geoprocessing Panel. 
4. Click on the **Globe icon** at the right of the drop-down and expand the Layers section. 
5. Select the **WGS 1984 UTM Zone 30N** projection and click **OK**.
6. Click **Run** to export the new Feature Class

Return to the **Standard Distance** Tool and run it again, this time using your **Deaths\_Allocated\_UTM** as the **Input Feature Class**

![](media/standarddistance.png)

The result should be a circle, whose diameter encompasses 68% of the **Deaths** in our dataset.

#### Bonus:  
Run the **Standard Distance** again, this time without a **Weight** field and observe the results. Now you are calculating the Standard Distance based upon the **LOCATIONS**. What effect has that had on the Standard Distance? Why?

![](media/sdnoweight.png)

### Creating a surface from Point Data to Highlight “Hotspots”

Hotspot mapping is a popular technique for quickly identifying "Hotspots" or other spatial structures in your data. At it simplest, you are having the software "interpolate" the values of the entire study area, based upon the discrete samples that our **Deaths\_Allocated\_UTM** represent. 

#### Kernel Density

The Kernel Density Tool calculates a magnitude per unit area from the point features using a kernel function to fit a smoothly tapered surface to each point. The result is a raster dataset which can reveal “hotspots” in the array of point data.

1. Toggle off the visibility of all but your **Water Pumps** layer
2. Return to the Geoprocessing Panel and **Search** for "**Kernel Density**", then click to launch the tool
3. Use the following settings, and click **Run**:  

|              Setting: | Value                  |
|----------------------:|------------------------|
| Input point features: | Deaths\_Allocated\_UTM |
|     Population field: | Num_Cases              |
|        Output raster: | DeathTopo              |
|     Output cell size: | 1                      |
|        Search radius: | 50                     |
|           Area units: | Square kilometers      |
|   Output cell values: | Densities              |
|               Method: | PLANAR                 |  

Note that the "Hottest" spot on the resulting map lies directly beneath the **Broad Street Pump**

## Creating a Basic Map Layout (in process)


### Add a Layout & Data Frame

1. Save your work if you haven't in a while.
2. On the Insert Tab, at top of ArcGIS Pro, Click on the **New Layout** button and select **ANSI - Landscape> Letter** to add a new layout to your ArcGIS Pro Project.
3. On the Insert Tab, again, click the **Map Frame** tool, select your John Snow map from the top row. 
4. Drag a squar(ish) box that fills the page as much as possible to place the Data Frame on the page.

### Activate the Map

In order to edit and adjust the map view, you need to activate the map in your layout, so that navigation and other tools are applied **WITHIN** the **Data Frame**, rather than on the **Layout Page**, itself.

1. Click on the **Layout Tab**, then click on the **Activate** button, to make your Data Frame active.
2. Use your mouse and scroll wheel to zoom into the central part of the map so the the edges of the Voronoi layer don't display. Alternatively, you can Right-Click on the **DeathTopo** layer and **Zoom to layer**
3. Toggle on and off your layers until the following are toggled on and visible, in the following order:  

 * **Deaths\_Allocated\_Mean\_CenterW**
 * **Water Pumps**
 * **Deaths\-Allocated\_UTM**
 * **Voronoi**
 * **Light Gray Base**

4. Use Ctrl-clicks to select these layers and then right-click>Group them. Rename the Group "In Map"
5. Remove the remaining layers by Ctrl-click selecting and right-click>Remove.

### Add an SVG Symbol

1. With the Map Frame still activated, Select the **Deaths\_Allocated\_Mean\_CenterW** layer and Click on the Appearance Tab
2. Click on the **Symbology** button to open the Symbology Panel.
3. In the Symbology Panel, click on the current **Symbol** point to open it's properties.
4. Change to the **Properties** Tab, then click on the **Layers** button to begin importing a new symbol.

5. Click on the **File...** button, browse to your **/data/** folder and select the **frackingwater.svg** and click **OK** to open it. 
6. Set the **Size** to 48pt
7. Change teh Color to Blue
8. Change the **Element** target to the water drop (you may have to scroll down to see it), then change its color to **Yellow**.
9. Click **Apply** to commit the changes.
